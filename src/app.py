CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """Task:Generate Cypher statement to query a graph database.
Instructions:
Graph node names are capitalized. Relationship names are in all caps. For example gender is "Male" or "Female". 
Here are the relationships in the graph:

NODES:
    1. Patient
        - name
        - age
        - gender
        - blood Type
    2. Disease
    3. Doctor
    4. Hospital
    5. InsuranceProvider
    6. Medication

RELATIONSHIPS between NODES:

    1. Patient - [:HAS_CONDITION] -> Disease
    2. Patient - [:ADMITTED_TO] -> Hospital
        - Properties:
            - dateOfAdmission
            - dischargeDate
            - billingAmount
            - roomNumber
            - admissionType
            - testResults
    3. Patient - [:INSURED_BY] -> InsuranceProvider
    4. Patient - [:TAKES] -> Medication
    5. Patient - [:TREATED_BY] -> Doctor

For example if user asks something like "What is the admission type of Kyle Fuller?"
You should use relationship properties between Patient and Hospital to answer the question.
For example:
MATCH (p:Patient where name: "Kyle Fuller")-[rel:ADMITTED_TO]->(h:Hospital)
RETURN rel.admissionType

The question is:
{question}"""
